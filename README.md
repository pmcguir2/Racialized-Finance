# Racialized-Finance
In this repository, we walk users through data analysis of the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances to highlight racial biases in lending outcomes.

The main file in our repository is a tutorial - an RStudio Script - which guides users through the proces of obtaining, understanding, and analyzing the survey data. We also provide commentary and discuss our findings in this tutorial. In order to follow along with the tutorial, users should understand the very basics of using RStudio, which can be downloaded at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. 

For an excellent primer and introduction to R and RStudio, see this video by freeCodeCamp.org: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V8eKsto3Ug.
